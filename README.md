# netflix-ui start branch


###

This is a project where we present a Back office functionality to a copy of the Netflix page. Delete, edit and create work, and on the FE, once the user chooses a genre, covers of various already existing movies show up. Once clickin on one of the, a modal window opens, with details about that movie (modal actually opens either the first or the last one, since I haven't yet been able to figure that out). The edit button underneath, takes the user to the back office page, for the user to edit or delete the movie. If the user wants to create a new movie, they would need to click on the Backoffice button, on the navigation bar.
